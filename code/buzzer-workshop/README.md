# TecDay workshops

This directory contains code used in [TecDay workshops](https://mint.satw.ch/de/tecdays) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mQHXIQStcOeRqYYq0V22RoXC8ZxgCNiyWtwlvKgAjnA/edit)). These workshops do not use the full BreadboardBot, but a cheaper kit, consisting of a breadboard, a Xiao RP2040, a passive buzzer, a button and 5 dupont wires. They are a conceptual predecessor to BreadboardBot and a $5 intro project for it.

The code was used with [CircuitPython 7](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/bin/seeeduino_xiao_rp2040/en_GB/adafruit-circuitpython-seeeduino_xiao_rp2040-en_GB-7.3.3.uf2) firmware.
